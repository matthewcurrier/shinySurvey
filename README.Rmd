## Installation

You can install the development version of shinySurvey from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("pak") -->
<!-- pak::pak("matthewcurrier/shinySurvey") -->
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(shinySurvey) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
